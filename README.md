---

A high-performance computational engine and structured toolkit designed to deconstruct complex problems, process advanced mathematical systems, and simulate quantum-safe computational models.

---

## 📖 Overview

Sol-Plex-Problems bridges the gap between abstract analytical theories, high-performance cloud execution, and advanced cryptographic security. By combining classical heuristic searches with simulated quantum logic (QKD, FHE), this repository serves as a cognitive engine capable of dynamic resource allocation, automated decision-making frameworks, and complex problem-solving.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

Based on the cognitive engine and deployment architecture, the project utilizes the following stack:

### Core Execution & Cognitive Layer

- **Python (Asyncio)** — Drives the asynchronous `AsyncSecureCognitiveEngine`, managing high-concurrency tasks without blocking the event loop.
- **Google Cloud AI Platform** — Leverages Generative AI models for matrix processing and mathematical simulations.
- **AIOHTTP** — Facilitates asynchronous API requests for the real-time `SolPlexSearch` agent.

### Infrastructure & Deployment (Terraform-Managed)

- **Terraform (HCL)** — Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) defining the entirety of the cloud environment.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:
  - **Compute Engine (Confidential VMs)** — Secures hardware-level execution with memory encryption (`enable_confidential_compute = true`).
  - **Firestore in Native Mode** — Persistent, long-term memory state storage for problem hashes and execution states.
  - **Cloud Memorystore (Redis)** — In-memory, high-speed data caching for the cognitive engine.
  - **Secret Manager** — Securely provisions and stores dynamic zero-trust keys and QKD-sifted keys.

### Security & Cryptography

- **Zero-Trust Architecture** — Every internal module validates dynamic signatures via HMAC before execution.
- **Simulated QKD (Quantum Key Distribution)** — Emulates BB84 protocol key generation and caching for secure inter-module communication.
- **FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) Simulation** — Ciphertext processing utilizing SHA-256 lattice-hash transformations.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `/.github/` — Continuous Integration and structural workflows.
- `/cognitive/` — The core Python execution modules (`math-engine.py`, `memory-manager.py`, `search-agent.py`) and quantum logic simulations.
- `/deploy/` — Terraform configurations (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`) for deploying the GCP architecture.
- `/frameworks/` — Markdown documentation covering Analytical, Decision-Making, Design-Thinking, and Systems frameworks.
- `/workflows/` — Standardized operational sequences (e.g., OODA loops, pre-mortems, system stress tests).
